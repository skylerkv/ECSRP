            <h2>Covid 19</h2>
            <p>
                COVID-19, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, emerged in late 2019 and quickly evolved into a global pandemic, profoundly impacting societies worldwide. This highly contagious respiratory<br>
                illness has presented unprecedented challenges, leading to widespread illness, loss of life, and significant disruptions to daily life. Governments and health organizations have implemented<br>
                various measures such as lockdowns, social distancing, and vaccination campaigns to curb the spread of the virus. The pandemic has not only strained healthcare systems but also exposed and <br>
                exacerbated social and economic inequalities. Efforts to combat COVID-19 continue through international collaboration, scientific advancements, and ongoing public health initiatives, highlighting <br>
                the collective resilience and adaptability of communities in the face of a complex global health crisis.
